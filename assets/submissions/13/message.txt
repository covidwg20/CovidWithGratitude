Joanna Chau-Ng

Dear frontline workers and essential workers, thank you for putting our health and needs first before yours. We especially want to thank those who are working to take care of young childrenâ€™s needs. We are truly thankful for the phone calls asking how we are doing, those who made sure we receive our immunizations and dental screening on-time, and librarians and family support workers who made sure little ones still have their baby programs.

- Joanna (mommy to a one-year-old)
