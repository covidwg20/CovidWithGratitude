Very thankful for the doctors, nurses and those in the front line doing all the hard work and carrying the stress. My grand uncle is hospitalized now, and my family gets updates from the hospital about how he's doing. My grand uncle's family doctor also contacted us. We're so thankful to hear news from my grand uncle. We can't visit in person at this time, but we're very thankful for everything the professionals are doing. Thank you.
