Ada and Charlie

Hi, I'm Charlie, mommy says we now have to keep #socialdistance from other doggos, so I'm actually running away from them and learnt "air" hi paw and "air" hugs hugs. Mommy says this keeps us all healthy and safe, and we're praying for health care workers almost every night. (Please don't tell her I'm doing it for extra treats)

From Ada -- I still run outside 3-4 times a week,and am thankful that everyone is obeying #socialdistancing.
