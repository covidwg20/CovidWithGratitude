Hello, and a big humongous thank you!

Thank you so much for your hard work these past months. I am so glad that you are here taking care of the people of our city. I think you'll be happy to know that I've been staying home and practicing social distancing (my friends know me as a big homebody).

Bless you, your health, and safety <3
