                As a group of quarantined college students from Koinonia Evangelical Church,
                we believe that—despite being stuck at home—there are still ways we can support
                our health care workers. With input from the community and health care workers,
                we’ve developed this website for the community to show their gratitude and for
                health care workers to be publicly appreciated. We are covered with blessings.
                We are #covidwithgratitude.
